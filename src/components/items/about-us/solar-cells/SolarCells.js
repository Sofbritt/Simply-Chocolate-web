                About='Normally, the sun is one of chocolate s worst enemies â€“ both sunlight and the heat from the rays help to destroy chocolate. But at Simply in Copenhagen, the two are actually best friends. We have got our very own solar cell system on the roof of the factory. This means that we are 100% self-sufficient in energy when the sun is shining. '
